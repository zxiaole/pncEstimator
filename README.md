# Environmental impact of aviation emission                       [<img src="/img/logo.jpg" width="144" height="120">](https://ie.ifu.ethz.ch/)
[Developed by the Chair ofÂ Air Quality and Particle Technology, headed by Prof. Dr. Jing Wang, at ETH Zurich](https://ie.ifu.ethz.ch/)

First, we develop the emission inventory of particle number for the Zurich Airport. The emission inventory is based on the detailed flight trajectories provided by [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/).
