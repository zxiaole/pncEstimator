# Estimate the Particle Number Concentration Using Machine Learning

We have developed a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the particle number concentration (PNC), which is mainly induced by the ultrafine particles below 100 nm. The ML model was trained using the unique long-term observations of PNC in Switzerland by the NABEL network.
